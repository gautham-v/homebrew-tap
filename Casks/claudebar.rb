# The template for the tap. On each `v*` tag `.github/workflows/release.yml`
# builds the universal .app, fills `version` and `sha256` in below, and pushes
# the result to github.com/gautham-v/homebrew-tap as `Casks/claudebar.rb`;
# users install with `brew install --cask gautham-v/tap/claudebar`.
# The values here are the last release's and need no hand edits.
