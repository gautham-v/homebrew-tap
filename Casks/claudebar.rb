# The Homebrew cask for claudebar.
#
# The template for the tap. On each `v*` tag `.github/workflows/release.yml`
# builds the universal .app, fills `version` and `sha256` in below, and pushes
# the result to github.com/gautham-v/homebrew-tap as `Casks/claudebar.rb`;
# users install with `brew install --cask gautham-v/tap/claudebar`.
# The values here are the last release's and need no hand edits.

  # The build is not notarized, so Gatekeeper refuses the first launch.
  caveats <<~EOS
    The app is signed ad hoc, not notarized. On first launch macOS will say it
    cannot verify the developer. Open it anyway with:

      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway

    or clear the quarantine flag and launch it:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Claudebar.app
      open /Applications/Claudebar.app

    Then turn on "Launch at login" from the popover.
