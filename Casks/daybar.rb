# The Homebrew cask for daybar.
#
# The template for the tap. On each `v*` tag `.github/workflows/release.yml`
# builds the universal .app, fills `version` and `sha256` in below, and pushes
# the result to github.com/gautham-v/homebrew-tap as `Casks/daybar.rb`;
# users install with `brew install --cask gautham-v/tap/daybar`.
# The values here are the last release's and need no hand edits.

  caveats <<~EOS
    On first launch macOS asks for calendar access; Daybar shows no events
    until it is granted. Change it later under:

      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars

    Turn on "Launch at login" from the ··· menu if you want it.
